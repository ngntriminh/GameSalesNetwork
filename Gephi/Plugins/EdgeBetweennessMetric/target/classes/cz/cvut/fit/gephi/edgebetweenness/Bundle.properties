OpenIDE-Module-Name= Edge Betweenness Metric
OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description= Edge betweenness of an edge as the number of shortest paths between pairs of nodes that run along it
OpenIDE-Module-Display-Category= Metric
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
This plugin computes the Edge Betweenness metric, which can be used in Social Network Analysis.\
Edge betweenness of an edge as the number of shortest paths between pairs of nodes that run along it.\
<h3>Tutorial</h3>\
<p>Computation of Edge Betweenness can be started using "Statistics" panel.</p>\
<ul><li>Edge Betweenness can be computed either on directed or undirected graph.</li>\
<li>You can use Normalize parameter. This parameter will normalize computed values between 0 and 1.</li>\
</ul>\
<br />\
</p>\
<p>Computed values will be available in Data laboratory (column named Edge Betweenness).</p>
